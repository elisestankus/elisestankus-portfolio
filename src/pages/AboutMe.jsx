                Hi there! I'm Elise, a full-stack web developer currently residing in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
                From designing clean, elegant front-ends to building efficient, robust back-ends, web development allows me to engage my creative side and apply my strong problem-solving skills. 
                I have a Bachelor's of Science in Pharmacology from UC Santa Barbara and I've completed UC Berkeley's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. 
                In addition to coding, I also enjoy reading, running, and designing knitwear.
